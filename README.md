# Sample Application of Techexcellence Session 7.12.22 (Alina Liburkina, Oliver Zihler)
You can run it as a Spring Boot Application (see Application.java). 

The main entry point is CreateDancingEventResource (--> REST Controller). 

You can run it and send a POST request using sample-create-dancing-event-request.json.

We didn't implement it fully. The presenter adapter e.g. don't map the received data to a corresponding http response.

Else, it contains everything Clean Architecture requires.
